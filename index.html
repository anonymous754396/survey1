<h1>Subjective Evaluation of Audios</h1>
  
<h2>Dear users,</h2>
<h2>This website is about an audio-based project requiring your subjective opinion of audio files. We present a pair of audios at a time, and each pair corresponds to a question on the survey. The ID of audio pairs (i.e., "Q1" ) matches the "Q1" on the survey. You have to listen to a pair of audios and then answer the corresponding question on the survey. </h2> 
	
<h2> We highly appreciate your time and contribution to the out project! </h2> 
	
<h2> <FONT COLOR="red"> You have two tasks: (1) Provide your subjective opinions about if two speeches are from the same speaker. (2) Provide your subjective opinions about whether the audio's contents are clearly expressed. </FONT></h2>
